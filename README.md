# LÃ©o-21's Dotfiles

Hi ! These are my dotfiles for my different configurations. Every branch is a different configuration, apart from the main branch, which holds the README.md file you're currently reading.

Each branch is named following this format : [OS]-[Window Manager/Desktop environment]-[Laptop or Desktop PC]

### Installation

This repo is designed to works with git bare repositories, and I could make it work thanks to [this guide by Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles).
